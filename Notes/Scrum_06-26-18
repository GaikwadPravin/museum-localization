# Scrum 05/30/2018
## Participants: 
Pravin, Sonali, Rosa

## TODO List
1. Work on the interpolation for HRIR
2. Download MATLAB 
3. **IMPORTANT: Rewrite your own understanding of the code**
4. Convolution Performance

## Other Notes
### Rosa
ITD Interpolation - Use a hash table (python dictionary) for Elevation 0 and 180 where the keys are the azimuth 
Pravin says not to do any calculation in real-time (I am still confused on what he means) we have data for HRIR before we render
Work on HRIR interpolation

### Pravin 
Convolution - time domain. Tested that if the number of sampes is less than 15 then it is better to do it in time domain.
Algorithmic technique to not find the azimuth at current time.
Question (from Rosa): how would you know be able to caculate the future azimuth if we're not given the azimuth originally?
Plan for this week: Convolution (from numpy library) using Fast Fourier Transform

### Sonali
Install MATLAB - laptop does not support current drivers for UF Apps Website.
Implementing and understanding the MATLAB code into python
Plan for this week: Interpolation and implementing the MATLAB code into python
