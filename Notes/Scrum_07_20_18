### Future task: introduce orientation

## Sonali
Received orientation from sensor beacon
The data is unstable
understanding the sensor beacon
Tried to get orientation using two beacons is not unstable, 
Has experimented for 90 degree and the beacon displays the correct information
Used the command prompt to print the degree values while gradually moving the sensors.
The command prompt showed that the degrees decreased by one degree
Accuracy check complete for smaller angles and 360 rotation.

### Future Task: Use an algorithm to stablize the sensor data. Noise Reduction Algorithm

### Chris Advice: It is normal for the data to be unstable because of noise in the real world.
Every tme you get new data from the beacon, calculate the average. 
If the the calculation is outside the threshold then try to stablize with algorithm.

Directly streaming the 3D audio noise to the sound card - no wav file necessary.
Multithreading to compute the next convovled sounds.

### Future Task: Retrieve the sound from the thread. See if there exists a gap between the two sounds. 
Changing the sound for every change in azimuth - replacing frames.
