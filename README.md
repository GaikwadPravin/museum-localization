# Museum Localization

## Important Things
* Constantly checking the [Notes](./Notes) to find the TODO list and other related notes
* **NEVER** push to the master branch on main repository directly. Instead, go through the Following workflow EVERY TIME you want to add something to the main repository: `Fork->Clone->Edit->Commit->Pull->Push->Pull Request`
* Test Driven Development, test before implementation.
* Document everything
* Ask questions if you don't know something.
